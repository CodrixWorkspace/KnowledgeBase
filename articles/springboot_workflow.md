# Build a Lightweight Workflow with Spring Boot and Flowable

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through creating a lightweight business process using Spring Boot and Flowable BPM, modeled around a realistic use case: an options trade approval for the SPY ETF.

## ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Scenario: SPY Options Trade Approval

Letâ€™s say a trader wants to submit an options trade. Depending on the risk level, the trade might need automatic validation or manual approval. Here's how the process flows:

- Trader submits a trade request.
- The system validates the request using predefined rules.
- A gateway checks if the trade is high-risk.
- If high-risk, itâ€™s routed for manager approval.
- Upon approval, the trade is executed automatically.
- Finally, the trader is notified about the outcome.

This mimics real-world scenarios where a mix of automation and human review is necessary.

## ðŸ§° Setting Up the Workflow

You can either use the locally hosted Flowable Modeler or experiment with a cloud-based BPMN editor to quickly prototype your workflow.

- ðŸ”— Try [Flowable Cloud Modeler](https://www.flowable.com/trial) or other online BPMN tools like bpmn.io.
- ðŸ“¦ For production or exportable models, use the official Flowable Modeler with Docker or local setup.

Once modeled, export the process as XML and place it under `src/main/resources/processes/trade-approval.bpmn20.xml`

## ðŸ§° Visualizing the Workflow

Here's a snapshot of the workflow diagram that powers this project:

This BPMN diagram consists of the following elements:

- ðŸ”¹ Start Event â€“ Triggers the workflow
- ðŸ”¹ Service Task (Validate Trade) â€“ Validates the incoming trade request
- ðŸ”¹ Exclusive Gateway â€“ Determines whether the trade is high-risk
    - ðŸ”¸ If Yes â†’ routes to User Task for Manager Approval
    - ðŸ”¸ If No â†’ proceeds directly
- ðŸ”¹ Service Task (Execute Trade) â€“ Executes the trade
- ðŸ”¹ End Event â€“ Ends the workflow

Once modeled, export the process as XML and place it under:

src/main/resources/processes/trade-approval.bpmn20.xml
