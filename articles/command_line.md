# Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Windows Command Line Basics

The Command Prompt (CMD) is a powerful command-line interpreter application found in most Windows operating systems. It allows you to interact with your computer using text-based commands, providing a direct line of communication with your system.

Benefits of using Command Prompt:

- Rapid navigation and efficient file management.
- Access to advanced system tools not readily available through the graphical interface.

## How to Get Started with Command Prompt

To open the Command Prompt:

- Press the Windows + R keys, type 'cmd', and hit Enter.
- Alternatively, you can search for "Command Prompt" in the Start Menu.

## Fundamental Command Prompt Commands

- To list the contents of the current directory, use:

      dir 
      dir /w  #For wide listing format
      dir /a  #To include hidden files

- To change the current directory, use:

      cd ~/Documents

- To clear the screen, use:

      cls

## Handling Files and Directories in Command Prompt

- To create a new directory, use:

      mkdir MyNewFolder

- To delete a directory, use:

      rmdir MyNewFolder

- To copy one or more files to another location, use:

      copy *.txt C:\Backup

- To move or rename files and directories, use:

    Here, '0A' sets the background to black and the text to green.

## Working with Environment Variables in Command Prompt

You can display, set, or remove environment variables using the following commands:

      set  # To display all variables
      set PATH  # To display PATH variable

      echo "New Line" >> filelist.txt

You can also use a file as input for a command:
