# Demystifying LLMs: Core Concepts for Beginners

A beginner-friendly guide to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) actually work — without the jargon overload.

📣 This guide is part of the SkillHunt User Guides series — your go-to collection of practical, beginner-friendly tutorials across tech, productivity, and everyday problem solving.

## 🧠 What Is an LLM?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained to understand and generate human language. They do this by analyzing vast amounts of text and learning patterns — kind of like how we get better at language by reading and writing more.

Think of an LLM as a supercharged autocomplete that doesn’t just finish your sentences — it can write essays, code, emails, poems, and more.

*Examples:* GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini

## 🔢 Parameters: The Model’s Memory Knobs

Parameters are like tiny switches or knobs in the model that get adjusted during training. The more parameters, the more capacity a model has to capture complex patterns.

**GPT-3:** 175 billion parameters

**GPT-4 and Claude 3:** even more (exact counts vary)

**LLaMA 3:** 8B and 70B variants

Bigger isn’t always better, but it often means the model can understand more nuance.

👉 As of now, models like **GPT-4** and **Gemini 1.5** are among the largest known, with rumored parameter counts in the trillions — though exact figures aren't publicly confirmed.

## 🔤 Tokens: The Building Blocks of Language

LLMs don’t process full words — they process tokens. A token might be a word, part of a word, or even punctuation.

- “ChatGPT is great!” = 5 tokens
- “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” = 1 token (surprisingly!)

Why it matters:

- Token limits control how much input/output you can have.
- API costs are usually calculated per token.

**🧪 Try it yourself:** Visualize how your input is tokenized using tools like:

- [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)
- [Hugging Face Tokenizer Viewer](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index)

## 📏 Context Window: How Much the Model Can “Remember”

Whenever you're chatting with a tool like ChatGPT, it doesn't actually "remember" your past conversation like a human would. Instead, each time you send a new message, the entire conversation history (up to the token limit) is sent back to the model as part of the prompt. This includes your previous messages and the model’s past replies, forming the context for generating the next response.

This is why:

- Longer conversations may lead to earlier parts being "forgotten" once the token limit is exceeded.
- The model can seem coherent within a session — but it’s just because all your previous exchanges are sent with each new query.

The context window is the number of tokens the model can consider at once — like its memory span for a conversation.

- GPT-3.5: ~4,000 tokens
- GPT-4: up to 128,000 tokens (that’s ~300 pages of text!)

Longer context = better continuity and understanding of long documents or chats.

## 🧪 Prompt Engineering: Talking to LLMs the Smart Way

Prompting is the art of giving the model the right instructions — the clearer and more structured your input, the better the output.

There are two fundamental strategies to know:

### 🔹 Zero-shot Prompting

You provide the task with no examples, relying on the model’s pretraining.

**Example Prompt:**

```prompt

    Translate the following sentence into French:
    "Good morning, how are you?"
```

The model figures it out based on its general training. Great for simple, well-known tasks.

- Zero-shot: "Translate this to French."
- Few-shot: "Here are 3 examples. Now do the next one."

### 🔹 Few-shot Prompting

You include a few examples in your prompt to show the model what kind of input/output pattern you're expecting. This gives it a frame of reference to generate better results.

**Example Prompt:**

```prompt

My child has the following skills:
- Can count up to 100
- Can add and subtract numbers up to 20
- Struggles with word problems

Give a personalized 2-week plan to improve their math skills.

---

My child has the following skills:
- Knows multiplication tables up to 5
- Struggles with division and fractions

Give a personalized 2-week plan to improve their math skills.

---

My child has the following skills:
- Can solve basic equations like x + 3 = 5
- Struggles with multi-step problems and lacks confidence in math

Give a personalized 2-week plan to improve their math skills.
```

Here, the model understands the format and continues generating similar plans based on each child’s input. You’re showing it how to respond through examples, just like teaching by showing.

The model learns from the examples and continues the pattern. This is especially useful for tasks that need formatting, tone, or special logic.

Good prompts = better responses. Think of it as giving the model a well-written assignment brief instead of a vague question.

## 🎲 Temperature and Top-p: Creativity Dials

These settings control randomness:

- Temperature (0–1): Lower = more predictable, Higher = more creative
- Top-p (aka nucleus sampling): Picks from the top % of likely options

Use low temperature for facts, high for stories.

## 🧬 Training vs Fine-tuning vs Inference

- Training: Feeding a massive dataset into the model to learn patterns
- Fine-tuning: Further training on a smaller, specific dataset
- Inference: The actual moment the model generates output

You don’t retrain the model when you chat — you’re using inference.

## 🧠 Embeddings: Understanding the “Meaning” of Words

Embeddings turn words and sentences into numbers that reflect their meaning.

- Helps with search, clustering, semantic similarity
- Example: “king - man + woman = queen” (in vector space!)

## 🧾 Final Note

Understanding these core concepts gives you a strong foundation to interact with LLMs effectively — whether you're building with them, writing prompts, or just having fun.

Next time someone drops a phrase like "128K context" or "embedding vectors," you'll smile — because now you get it.
