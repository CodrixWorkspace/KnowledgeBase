# Demystifying LLMs: Core Concepts for Beginners

A beginner-friendly guide to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) actually work â€” without the jargon overload.

## ðŸ§  What Is an LLM?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained to understand and generate human language. They do this by analyzing vast amounts of text and learning patterns â€” kind of like how we get better at language by reading and writing more.

Think of an LLM as a supercharged autocomplete that doesnâ€™t just finish your sentences â€” it can write essays, code, emails, poems, and more.

*Examples:* GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini

## ðŸ”¢ Parameters: The Modelâ€™s Memory Knobs

Parameters are like tiny switches or knobs in the model that get adjusted during training. The more parameters, the more capacity a model has to capture complex patterns.

**GPT-3:** 175 billion parameters

**GPT-4 and Claude 3:** even more (exact counts vary)

**LLaMA 3:** 8B and 70B variants

Bigger isnâ€™t always better, but it often means the model can understand more nuance.
